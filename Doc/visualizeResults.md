To visualize the results of the automated design space exploration, you can use a data visualization tool such as Python with libraries like Matplotlib or Pandas. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you visualize the results:

1. **Ensure Results are in a Structured Format**:
   Make sure the [`results.log`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22results.log%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjielei%2FProjects%2FUTS%2FautoDSE%2Freadme.md%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fjielei%2FProjects%2FUTS%2FautoDSE%2Freadme.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjielei%2FProjects%2FUTS%2FautoDSE%2Freadme.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A58%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") file is structured in a way that can be easily parsed. For example, each line should contain the parameters and their corresponding LUT utilization and latency values.

2. **Parse the Results**:
   Write a Python script to parse the [`results.log`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22results.log%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjielei%2FProjects%2FUTS%2FautoDSE%2Freadme.md%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fjielei%2FProjects%2FUTS%2FautoDSE%2Freadme.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjielei%2FProjects%2FUTS%2FautoDSE%2Freadme.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A58%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") file and extract the relevant data.

3. **Visualize the Data**:
   Use Matplotlib or another visualization library to create plots that show the tradeoff between resource usage and latency.

### Example Python Script

Here's an example Python script to parse the [`results.log`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22results.log%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjielei%2FProjects%2FUTS%2FautoDSE%2Freadme.md%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fjielei%2FProjects%2FUTS%2FautoDSE%2Freadme.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjielei%2FProjects%2FUTS%2FautoDSE%2Freadme.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A58%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") file and visualize the results:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Define the path to the results log file
log_file_path = 'results.log'

# Initialize lists to store the data
params = []
lut_utilization = []
latency = []

# Parse the log file
with open(log_file_path, 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        if 'LUT_utilization' in line and 'total_execute_time' in line:
            parts = line.split(',')
            param_values = parts[:7]
            lut_value = int(parts[7].split(':')[1].strip())
            latency_value = int(parts[8].split(':')[1].strip())
            
            params.append(param_values)
            lut_utilization.append(lut_value)
            latency.append(latency_value)

# Create a DataFrame
data = {
    'Parameters': params,
    'LUT Utilization': lut_utilization,
    'Latency': latency
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(df['LUT Utilization'], df['Latency'], c='blue', label='Design Points')
plt.xlabel('LUT Utilization')
plt.ylabel('Latency')
plt.title('Design Space Exploration Results')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Steps to Run the Script

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install matplotlib pandas
   ```

2. **Save the Script**:
   Save the above Python script to a file, e.g., `visualize_results.py`.

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to generate the visualization:
   ```sh
   python visualize_results.py
   ```

This script will read the [`results.log`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22results.log%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjielei%2FProjects%2FUTS%2FautoDSE%2Freadme.md%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fjielei%2FProjects%2FUTS%2FautoDSE%2Freadme.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjielei%2FProjects%2FUTS%2FautoDSE%2Freadme.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A58%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") file, extract the LUT utilization and latency values, and plot them on a scatter plot to help you visualize the tradeoff between resource usage and latency.
