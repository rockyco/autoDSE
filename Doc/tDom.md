To install the `tDOM` package on a Linux system, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Tcl and Tcl Development Packages**:
   Ensure that Tcl and the Tcl development packages are installed on your system. You can install them using your package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu), you can use:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install tcl tcl-dev
   ```

   On Red Hat-based systems (like CentOS), you can use:

   ```sh
   sudo yum install tcl tcl-devel
   ```

2. **Download and Install tDOM**:
   Download the latest version of `tDOM` from its official website or repository. You can use `wget` to download it directly from the command line. For example:

   ```sh
   wget http://tdom.org/downloads/tdom-0.9.4-src.tar.gz
   ```

   Extract the downloaded tarball:

   ```sh
   tar -xzf tdom-0.9.1.tar.gz
   cd tdom-0.9.1
   ```

3. **Compile and Install tDOM**:
   Compile and install `tDOM` using the following commands:

   ```sh
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

   This will compile `tDOM` and install it into the appropriate directories.

4. **Verify Installation**:
   You can verify that `tDOM` is installed correctly by running a Tcl script that requires the `tDOM` package. Create a file named `test_tdom.tcl` with the following content:

   ```tcl
   package require tdom
   puts "tDOM package is installed successfully."
   ```

   Run the script using the Tcl interpreter:

   ```sh
   tclsh test_tdom.tcl
   ```

   If `tDOM` is installed correctly, you should see the message "tDOM package is installed successfully."

By following these steps, you should be able to install the `tDOM` package on your Linux system and use it in your Tcl scripts.
